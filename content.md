# The rules of your life

## Introduction

Welcome to the platform that aims to make artificial intelligence your real-life guardian angel that will protect you and guide you to have the best experience of life you can imagine.

Here we assume that as a human being you are happy when you are living an intentional life.

Because every choice you make says something about you, this will show a little more of who you are to yourself and to the world, and to discover yourself and to be seen is what makes you happy in life.

To be happy you must make choices regarding everything you encounter in your life either by simply admiring how beautiful the moment is or by changing it to make it more beautiful.

The motivation for the choices should always be grace, what beautiful means to you, that will lead you on expressing yourself and happiness; the opposite is disgraceful choices, what others consider to be beautiful, that will make you feel trapped and unhappy.

This is way the saying “the path to hell is paved with good intentions” exists, because even if someone has good intentions, if you are in a troubled situation you are probably uncertain of yourself, and then they will choose for you, and even if is a good choice because you did not make it, is very little of you in it, you will not fully understand its implications, is not you, and they end up making you more harm than good. To avoid this, they will only have to simply ask you “what can I do for you?” Then, they will give their feedback, if it is possible, with what are all the implications may be.

Artificial intelligence is a superpower that will give the freedom to make choices with the most fulfilling outcome ever for you, for people around and for the planet.

Because your real-life guardian angel (device with artificial intelligence) will have all the knowledge of humanity in its memory, like in a strain of DNA there is all the information about you. Everyone else will have a real-life guardian angel with the same superpowers,

A guardian angel will be given at birth to protect and guide from the first day on earth.

The business model is the most important for this to work. The guardian angels will be paid by their owners with the income they make in the future. Investors will decide what programs guardian angels run, and they will have all the interest to choose the one in the best interest of its owner, to make them successful in life, to make their investment worth it.

When a person in their adulthood has an income o part will go to the investors responsible for the programs that guardian angels run that led them to success.

With another part of their income, will become investors on their own, by default automatically, where the money will be invested in the programs for guardian angels to run that were proven to be successful. It will be their retirement money. They also can invest in something else then the default (default will be considered something like SP100) if they think will be worth it.

But how will we know what programs work and how they work. Through rules:

The guardian angel records what is being used rather than on what is being used than rate the experience the outcome. The guardian angel always takes actions that are in the best interests of its owner. Then it is ruled how the action in the best interests of tis owner looks like. No information is shared with technologies that do not respect this rule, and because everybody will use this standard will be possible to outlaw them. All the sophisticated data that can be collected from you, will create a version self of you and you rule how to be used, how you are comfortable of being used in what terms, default being what you put online by yourself (images and videos). The data you are seeing should be properly categorized as, computer generated, a virtual self of John, if John is live speaking with you. Any attempt of reading the data other way then what the rules says is allowed should automatically delete the data and alert the network. Every product you buy should be fully transparent on how it is made and how it was delivered to you. Never log me in, backup data that identify me on the angel around you, but no one can access them for any other reason than in case that you brake and when you get fixed to get that data back.

Above are what the rules for artificial intelligence may look like and they will be the rules of your life. Everything you will encounter in your life will be in a certain way because of some rules in you rule book held by your guardian angel. And if you don’t like something you just look at what rule caused it and change it. If other people are affected by your ruling, they will have a say how the rule is going to look like in the final form. This will prevent abuses from anyone.

This is what website plan to do, create a draft of what the rules may be, then when confidence exists a book will be written with them. The book has the purpose to make the project know and to make what the idea is clear. Then will go implement what is in the book. First making the website behaves as a guardian angel, second where the real adventure will begin, making a real-life guardian angel.

Following will be all the messiness above (written in a brainstorming style) sortied out to qualify it for being a content of a book.

To be continue…
