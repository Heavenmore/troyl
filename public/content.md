# The rules of your life

## Introduction

At this moment this website introduces its concept to the world. It aims to explain it clearly and convincingly for other people to join in to be put into practice.

Is about how Artificial intelligence (AI) can be the best ally you can have in life, where it guides and protects you for the best life you can imagine.

For this to happen we need a business model that rewards when AI works in the best interest of the people it is interacting with. 
Because no one knows better than you what is best for you, you should be the one that decides what are the rules after which AI operates. 

As everyone else will do the same, the biggest risk where AI is used for evil is avoided because the rules will include how people want to interact with each other in a supportive and enjoyable way from the perspective where AI exists. 

The following are what the rules may be like. They will have a title to be easily identifiable and its content in one or more paragraphs.

Once the rules written on this website confidingly illustrate the concept, they will be compiled into a book to furthermore showcase the concept to the world.

## Interaction

You make your ruling with the help of AI in a conversational style (conversational editing). You write or say “I want” using the first person and the AI will responds back with “You want” using the second person, showing you that understands what you want.

This is where this website plans to implement first, conversation editing. 

When you make a rule there will, there are no options to keep it private it or publish it, the rule itself will involve other people or not. If the rule involves other people, they will respond back with their ruling, and this will go back and forth until all parties are happy with the outcome.

## Managing

The purpose of managing is to handle with a rule everything that life throws at you, for everyone to have a pleasant experience when interacting with one another when deciding where the world should go.

For example, someone is ruling that you should invest in oil. Your response rule may be that you would not do that, and similar further request should be ignored. 

They may response with the consequence of your inaction. Then you rule that for the current information you have, you will go along and invest in green energy.

They may personally want to contact you. You rule that someone with their profile can’t contact you. 

Then they come to your city and invite everyone. You rule that someone with their profile can’t invite you to any event and you should be informed where these types of events are held to avoid them.

Can they rule that they can come unannounced to your current location? Yes. But you only interact with people that are transparent with their intentions and respect your boundaries. 

## Reciprocity

What you do to others you do to yourself.

When you say “I want from you this in exchange for this” it also means that everybody else is you having the same request and you are them. 

This ensures that a fair deal is made. 

If you are happy with the outcome the condition of the deal becomes important because other people finding themselves in the same conditions will make the same deal as you and you will be credited for it. 

## Business model

The authors of the rules are responsible for what the outcome of those rules may be. If the outcome is positive there is a reward. The reward is split between authors, each getting a percentage depending on how much they contributed.

Once the website implements conversational editing *, will also implement the percentage of responsibility where everybody is credited for the existing content each with their percentage of responsibility.

This is how the authors will make money on the website.

E.g., You rule: 
“I want to buy products only from manufacturers that handle the resources of the planet responsible”. 

The response will at first be with suggestion to “green” website maybe with referral links. 

Then there will be a debate of how accurate those “green” websites are. 

The discussion will continue and will eventually lead to rules that identify with accuracy manufacturers that have the same values as you. 

Then when a purchase is made the profit is split between the manufacturers and with the authors of the rules that lead you to the purchase. Each one should get their fair share from the profit each getting a percentage depending on how much they contributed for the product to be in your hands.

## Inheritance 

Most of the rules will be inherited because most of what is around us is created by others before us. 

You only must rule when the situation at hand requests it. Eventually everything will be as you expected, and you just enjoy the ride.

Newcomers will start with an already comprehensive set of rules, depending on what worked best for others before.
